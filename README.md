This is a collection of scripts and notes.

Its not private as such - but I'm using it as a scratch space and bucket for ideas - so very little will make sense most of the time.

That said, you might wanna check out:

* CannyOS-Build.sh
	This is a script (that wont work!) that contains references to the build scripts for all CannyOS docker containers. (and will eventually build a full CannyOS dev enviroment, it also has links for cleaning up Ubuntu and installing docker etc...)

* CannyOS-CoreOS-Cluster-Launcher.sh
	This will launch a cluster of CoreOS machines, and set them up for running the CannyOS userland.
